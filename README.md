# Student Loan Risk Prediction with Deep Learning

A machine learning project that uses deep learning techniques to predict student loan default risk.

## Overview

This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build a neural network model for predicting the likelihood of student loan defaults based on various factors.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- pathlib

## Model

The implementation uses a Sequential neural network with Dense layers from Keras.

## Data Processing

- StandardScaler for feature normalization
- train_test_split for dataset partitioning
